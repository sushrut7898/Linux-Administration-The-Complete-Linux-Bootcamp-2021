Hirarchical File System
ls / => Root Directory File System
df displays amount of available disk space 
df -h
ls ~ => Current users home Directory
etc => system configuration files
lib => Shared files used by applications
media => external storage
tmp => Temporary files/ files may be deleted anytime without any notice
proc => files / directories generated at computer start, cpu info, memory info
srv => info for servers
var => contains variable length file i.e. logs, etc.


The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard - 1
● /bin contains binaries or user executable files which are available to all users.
● /sbin contains applications that only the superuser (hence the initial s) will need.
● /boot contains files required for starting your system.
● /home is where you will find your users’ home directories. Under this directory there is another
directory for each user, if that particular user has a home directory.
root has its home directory separated from the rest of the users’ home directories and is /root
● /dev contains device files.
● /etc contains most, if not all system-wide configuration files.
● /lib contains shared library files used by different applications.
● /media is used for external storage will be automatically mounted.
● /mnt is like /media but it’s not very often used these days.

The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard - 2
● /tmp contains temporary files, usually saved there by applications that are running.
Non-privileged users may also store files here temporarily.
● /proc is a virtual directory. It contains information about your computer hardware, such as
information about your CPU, RAM memory or Kernel. The files and directories are generated
when your computer starts, or on the fly, as your system is running and things change.
● /sys contains information about devices, drivers, and some kernel features.
● /srv contains data for servers.
● /run is a temporary file system which runs in RAM.
● /usr contains many other subdirectories binaries files, shared libraries and so on. On some
distributions like CentOS many commands are saved in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin instead of /bin
and /sbin.
● /var typically contains variable-length files such as logs which are files that register events that
happen on the system.

cd => change directory
pwd => print working directory
ls directoryname => Display contents of directory

Path Names - Absolute and Relative
Absolute -> path from root directory, starts with forward slash
Relative -> starts with current working directory
. -> Current directory
.. -> Parent directory ls ../..

sudo apt install tree
tree => to display directories in hirarchical manner
